# Figure 0: Democratic backsliding over time

## What the figure shows
This figure plots the share of countries experiencing a democratic backsliding event in each year of the dataset. A backsliding event is defined as a year-to-year decline in the V-Dem polyarchy index of at least 0.01 points. The horizontal axis represents calendar years, and the vertical axis represents the proportion of countries in the sample meeting this criterion.

## How to interpret this figure
Higher values indicate that a larger share of countries experienced democratic backsliding in that year. The increase in coverage after 1990 reflects the growing number of countries included in the dataset rather than a sudden change in global political conditions. The figure should be read as descriptive and contextual rather than as evidence of causal dynamics.

## Why this figure matters
This figure provides background motivation for the analysis by illustrating that democratic backsliding is a recurring and non-trivial phenomenon in the post–Cold War period. It establishes the relevance of studying early-warning indicators without making claims about the causes or mechanisms of democratic decline.

## Notes and limitations
The figure does not distinguish between the severity or persistence of backsliding events and does not account for country-specific characteristics. It is intended solely to contextualise the empirical analysis that follows.
