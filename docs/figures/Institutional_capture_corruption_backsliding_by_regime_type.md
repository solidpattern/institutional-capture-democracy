# Institutional capture, corruption, and democratic backsliding by regime type

## What the figure shows
This figure shows predicted probabilities of democratic backsliding across different levels of institutional capture and corruption, plotted separately for different regime types. Regime types group countries by their overall level of democracy at the time of observation. Predictions are based on lagged regression models.

## How to interpret this figure
The figure compares how changes in institutional capture and corruption relate to backsliding risk in different political settings. In more democratic regimes, increases in capture or corruption are associated with noticeable increases in predicted backsliding risk. In less democratic regimes, predicted risk changes less sharply as capture or corruption increases.

The figure should be read as a comparison of patterns across groups, not as a statement about inevitability or causation.

## Why this figure matters
This figure shows that institutional indicators are most informative when democratic institutions are still functioning to some degree. Where democratic erosion is already advanced, additional increases in capture or corruption provide less new information about short-term backsliding risk. This helps clarify where institutional indicators are likely to serve as useful early-warning signals and where they are less informative.

## Notes and limitations
The figure reflects model-based predictions and depends on how regime types are classified. Regime categories are broad and may hide important differences across countries. The figure does not establish causal relationships and should be interpreted alongside other figures and robustness checks in the repository.
