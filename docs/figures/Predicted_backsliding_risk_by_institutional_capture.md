# Predicted backsliding risk by institutional capture

## What the figure shows
This figure displays model-based predicted probabilities of democratic backsliding across different levels of institutional capture. The predictions are generated from logistic regression models using lagged capture indicators and represent the estimated likelihood of a backsliding event in the subsequent year.

## How to interpret this figure
Higher values of institutional capture correspond to higher predicted probabilities of democratic backsliding. The vertical scale reflects changes in risk rather than certainty: even at high capture levels, backsliding is not inevitable, but it becomes substantially more likely. The figure should be read as illustrating relative risk differences rather than a precise forecasting rule.

## Why this figure matters
This figure translates regression results into an interpretable risk framework, making the substantive relevance of institutional capture clear. It shows that capture is not only temporally prior to democratic decline but also meaningfully informative about near-term backsliding risk, supporting its use as an early-warning indicator.

## Notes and limitations
Predicted probabilities are based on model estimates and depend on the specification and sample used. The figure does not establish causal effects and does not account for all possible country-specific factors. It should be interpreted alongside robustness checks and alternative specifications documented elsewhere in the repository.
