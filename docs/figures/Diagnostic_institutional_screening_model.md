# Diagnostic institutional screening model

## What the figure shows
This figure presents coefficient estimates and confidence intervals from a diagnostic logistic regression model predicting democratic backsliding using a broad set of lagged institutional indicators. All variables are entered simultaneously to assess their relative association with subsequent backsliding events. Coefficients are standardised to allow comparison across indicators.

## How to interpret this figure
Points to the right of zero indicate a positive association with backsliding risk, while points to the left indicate a negative association. Confidence intervals crossing zero suggest weaker or less robust relationships. The figure should be read as exploratory and diagnostic rather than as evidence of causal effects.

## Why this figure matters
This figure informs variable selection and model construction decisions used in the main analysis. Indicators related to legislative interference, electoral rule manipulation, political exclusion, and executive constraints show comparatively stronger and more stable associations with backsliding, motivating their inclusion in the composite institutional capture index. Other indicators appear weaker or more context-dependent and are therefore not emphasised in the headline results.

## Notes and limitations
The screening model is not intended as a final specification and does not include interaction terms, country fixed effects, or alternative functional forms. Results are sensitive to specification choices and should be interpreted as guiding model development rather than establishing definitive relationships.
