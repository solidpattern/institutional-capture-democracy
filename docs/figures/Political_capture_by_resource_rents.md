# Political capture by resource rents

## What the figure shows
This figure shows how levels of institutional capture vary across countries with different levels of resource rents. Resource rents are measured as the share of national income derived from natural resources, including oil, gas, minerals, coal, and forestry. Higher values indicate greater reliance on resource-based income.

## How to interpret this figure
The figure compares institutional capture across countries with lower and higher resource rents. Differences in capture levels indicate whether reliance on natural resource income is associated with systematically different institutional conditions. The figure should be read as a descriptive comparison rather than as evidence of causal effects.

## Why this figure matters
Resource rents are often discussed as a factor that can weaken institutional accountability by reducing governments’ reliance on taxation and broad-based economic activity. This figure helps assess whether higher resource dependence is associated with higher levels of institutional capture in the data, providing context for how economic structure may relate to institutional outcomes relevant for democratic backsliding.

## Notes and limitations
Resource rents are measured using aggregate national indicators and do not capture how revenues are distributed or managed within countries. The figure does not establish causal relationships and does not control for other institutional or economic factors that may influence capture levels. Results should be interpreted alongside other figures and robustness checks documented in the repository.
