# Institutional predictors of democratic backsliding

## What the figure shows
This figure presents coefficient estimates and confidence intervals from a logistic regression model predicting democratic backsliding using a range of lagged institutional indicators. Coefficients are shown on the log-odds scale, with a vertical reference line at zero indicating no association with backsliding risk.

## How to interpret this figure
Indicators plotted to the right of zero are associated with a higher estimated probability of democratic backsliding in the subsequent year, while indicators to the left are associated with lower estimated risk. Confidence intervals reflect uncertainty around these estimates; intervals crossing zero indicate weaker or less robust associations. The figure should be read as a comparative overview of associations within a single model specification rather than as evidence of causal effects or variable importance.

## Why this figure matters
This figure provides a consolidated view of how different institutional dimensions relate to democratic backsliding when considered jointly. It complements the baseline and diagnostic screening models by illustrating which indicators remain directionally aligned with backsliding risk in a more complete specification. The results help motivate the emphasis on institutional capture measures in the main analysis while reinforcing the decision not to rely on any single institutional indicator.

## Notes and limitations
Coefficient magnitudes depend on model specification, variable scaling, and correlations among indicators. The figure does not capture temporal sequencing or conditional effects and should not be interpreted as identifying necessary or sufficient conditions for democratic backsliding. It is included for transparency and diagnostic purposes rather than as a headline result.
