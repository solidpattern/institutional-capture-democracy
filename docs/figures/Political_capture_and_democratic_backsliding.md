# Political capture and democratic backsliding

## What the figure shows
This figure visualises the relationship between institutional capture and democratic backsliding using model-based estimates. It plots how changes in capture-related indicators are associated with the likelihood of a backsliding event in the subsequent year.

## How to interpret this figure
Higher values on the capture measure correspond to a greater estimated risk of democratic backsliding. The figure should be read as illustrating a probabilistic relationship rather than a deterministic threshold. It does not imply that backsliding will occur in all high-capture cases.

## Why this figure matters
This figure helps translate abstract model results into an interpretable pattern, showing that institutional capture is meaningfully associated with near-term democratic risk. It complements the event-study evidence by highlighting the substantive relevance of capture as an early-warning signal.

## Notes and limitations
The figure reflects associations estimated from lagged models and does not establish causal mechanisms. Results may vary across countries and institutional contexts, and the figure should be interpreted alongside robustness checks documented elsewhere in the repository.
