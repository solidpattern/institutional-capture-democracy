# Political capture and capital mobility

## What the figure shows
This figure presents model-based predicted probabilities of democratic backsliding across different levels of institutional capture, separated by levels of capital mobility. Capital mobility reflects how easily financial capital can move across national borders, based on the KAOPEN index. Predictions are derived from lagged regression models.

## How to interpret this figure
The figure shows that increases in institutional capture are associated with higher backsliding risk in all cases, but the size of this increase differs by capital mobility. In countries with lower capital mobility, predicted backsliding risk rises more sharply as capture increases. In countries with higher capital mobility, the same increase in capture is associated with a smaller change in predicted risk.

## Why this figure matters
This figure illustrates that institutional capture does not translate into democratic backsliding uniformly across contexts. Instead, the likelihood that institutional weakening is followed by democratic decline depends on economic conditions. The result highlights that early-warning signals based on institutional capture are more informative in some settings than others.

## Notes and limitations
The figure reflects conditional associations estimated from regression models and does not establish causal mechanisms. Capital mobility is used as a contextual modifier rather than a direct explanatory factor, and results may be sensitive to alternative specifications or threshold choices documented elsewhere in the repository.
