# Baseline institutional screening model

## What the figure shows
This figure presents coefficient estimates and confidence intervals from a baseline logistic regression model predicting democratic backsliding using a set of lagged institutional indicators. The model serves as an initial screening step, estimating associations between individual institutional measures and subsequent backsliding events.

## How to interpret this figure
Coefficients to the right of zero indicate a positive association with backsliding risk, while coefficients to the left indicate a negative association. Confidence intervals reflect uncertainty around these estimates. The figure should be read as an exploratory overview of which institutional indicators are plausibly related to democratic backsliding rather than as a definitive model.

## Why this figure matters
This baseline screening model provides an initial mapping of the institutional landscape associated with democratic backsliding. It helps identify which indicators merit closer attention in subsequent analyses and motivates the construction of more focused models and composite measures of institutional capture used later in the project.

## Notes and limitations
The baseline model does not include interaction terms, composite indices, or extensive robustness controls. Results are sensitive to specification choices and are intended to guide further analysis rather than establish causal relationships.
