# Political capture around democratic backsliding, by capital mobility

## What the figure shows
This figure plots average levels of institutional capture in the years surrounding the first observed democratic backsliding event (t = 0), separately for countries with lower and higher levels of capital mobility. Values are aligned by event time rather than calendar year to highlight temporal patterns before and after backsliding.

## How to interpret this figure
In both groups, institutional capture increases prior to the backsliding event, indicating that capture tends to rise before democratic decline begins. However, the level and trajectory of capture differ by capital mobility. Countries with lower capital mobility exhibit higher and more sustained levels of capture around the backsliding event compared to countries with higher capital mobility.

## Why this figure matters
This figure combines two core insights of the analysis: temporal ordering and contextual variation. It shows that institutional capture precedes democratic backsliding across different economic contexts, while also illustrating that the extent of capture is systematically higher in settings with lower capital mobility. This supports the interpretation that early-warning signals based on institutional capture are shaped by economic conditions.

## Notes and limitations
The figure is descriptive and does not isolate causal effects. Differences across capital-mobility groups may reflect underlying structural characteristics not fully captured by the model. The figure should be interpreted alongside the predicted-probability results and robustness checks documented elsewhere in the repository.
