# Institutional dynamics around the onset of democratic backsliding

## What the figure shows
This figure plots changes in selected institutional indicators in the years surrounding the first observed democratic backsliding event (t = 0). Indicators are aligned by event time rather than calendar year to highlight how institutional conditions evolve before and after the onset of backsliding.

## How to interpret this figure
Several institutional indicators exhibit elevated or worsening values prior to t = 0, indicating that institutional weakening begins before democratic backsliding becomes observable in electoral democracy measures. Some indicators appear relatively stable at high levels before backsliding, while others show more pronounced changes closer to the onset event. The figure should be read as descriptive evidence of sequencing rather than as a causal test.

## Why this figure matters
One pattern suggested by the figure is a distinction between background conditions and triggering actions. Indicators associated with systemic corruption often appear elevated well before democratic backsliding occurs, suggesting a persistent institutional vulnerability. In contrast, indicators capturing direct interference with legislatures or formal rule-making processes tend to change more sharply closer to the onset of backsliding.

This pattern is consistent with an interpretation in which corruption weakens institutional norms and accountability over time, while more direct forms of institutional interference translate these vulnerabilities into observable democratic decline. While exploratory, this distinction helps clarify how different dimensions of institutional capture may play distinct roles in the backsliding process.

## Notes and limitations
The figure aggregates patterns across countries and does not isolate causal mechanisms or formally test interactions between institutional indicators. Observed timing differences may reflect unmeasured contextual factors or country-specific dynamics. The figure is intended to motivate interpretation and further analysis rather than establish definitive causal claims.
