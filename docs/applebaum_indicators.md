# Applebaum-Aligned Indicators of Institutional Capture

This document maps mechanisms emphasized in Anne Applebaum’s *Autocracy, Inc.* to observable institutional indicators available in the V-Dem dataset. Indicators are classified as **primary** or **secondary** based on their centrality to the institutional capture mechanism. The final column indicates whether each indicator is used in the main analysis.
This mapping is not exhaustive. Several mechanisms central to Applebaum’s account—particularly offshore finance, transnational elite networks, and financial secrecy—are not directly observable in cross-national panel data and are therefore noted but not operationalised.
